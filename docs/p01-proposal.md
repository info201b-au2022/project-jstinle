### Abstract

Student debt has only continued to grow in the past few years overall and for individuals themselves; while it appears that many people take their debt with them all throughout their lives. Because of this, the main problem we plan to explore further is how and why student loan debt has only continued to increase as many students make payments and end up further in debt since it is an oxymoronic and damaging situation, especially for those struggling financially. This question concerns us, because as students that experience this problem first hand we not only see this problem for us, but also seeing the increase of student debt for other students nationally is an issue worth addressing. We will address this question by analyzing how student debt financial situations are for different categories of people and what advantages and drawbacks will arise with many governmental ideas constantly created to help in erasing student loan debt.

### Introduction

While student loan debt continues to skyrocket year after year, the number of students with outstanding student loan debt still continues to increase. Many current or former students reliably repay their student loans, yet their debt does not seem to decrease—it does the exact opposite and continues to surge as time continues. This leaves many first-generation and economically disadvantaged people who required the money initially vulnerable to accumulating levels of debt; taking loans in an attempt to better their current situations but ultimately ending up buried under their debt burdens. This problematic interest capitalization has inflated to increasingly higher amounts and targeted desperate people in untenable circumstances, leaving many crippled with the idea that they will pass away with student loan debt. This begs the questions: how does this system operate, why is this the case, and why has there been no solution to this trillion-dollar crisis?

### Problem Domain

TBD!

### Research Questions

In the United States, student loan debt is structured to be paid off in just 10 years, but on average it takes students about 20 years, with some being even over 30 years. What factors make it so difficult for students to repay their student loans?

In today’s society many desire for student  debt to be forgiven. With many bills currently being set in place to eliminate certain amounts of debt, this brings up the question of: what advantages and disadvantages would the economy and government have given the option to eliminate all student loan debt?

Over time the national student loan debt can be seen surging to record levels every year in trillions of dollars as more and more students continue to take out loans to fund their education. While there are many ideas put in place to relieve student debt, will this problem ever be resolved and how? If not, to what extent can student debt reach, or will it continue to rise to unimaginable heights?

### The Dataset

**Dataset 1: Data.world Student Loan Debts**

This dataset specifically targets different levels of and prevalence of borrowers of student loans per different groups such as loans per age group or frequency by levels of debt. This will help us understand if age plays a role in the repayment of loans, how long this problem has prevailed, and the effect of student debt on other personal economic situations.

High-ranking members (vice presidents, administrators, research officers, and economists) of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Research and Statistics Group conducted the research due to the, at the time, increased attention by policymakers and the media. The data collected was taken from the bank’s Consumer Credit Panel and anonymized Equifax credit data; so it follows that it is sponsored by their respective corporations. Since this data was recorded and analyzed directly by affiliate banks, it is safe to assume that the data is secure, credible, and trustworthy. We obtained the data through the google dataset search and credited Data.world, the website that makes the datasets accessible.

**Dataset 2: Statista Student Loan Forgiveness**

This dataset addresses the conflicts that many have regarding student loan forgiveness, it shows how student loan debt is continuing to rise but at the same time applications for student loan forgiveness are at the highest it's ever been as well. The data shows that more and more applications are being submitted, and while the application rate is booming, the acceptance rate is very slowly increasing in comparison to the denial rate. This then brings up the problem that as a nation, the student debt is not getting better, it is getting worse and there is not enough loan forgiveness acts put in place.

This data was collected by Melanie Hanson, she is an educator, research analyst and the senior editor for the Education Data Initiative. The data was collected up to November 30th, 2020 to show how much student loans have been forgiven and what types were forgiven the most. The research is not funded by any third parties, and is conducted by an organization that takes donations. Students fighting for more loan forgiveness can be benefitted, as well as policymakers in understanding the statistics behind student loan forgiveness in order to create bills regarding this topic. The data can be assumed that it is trustworthy because it is data collected from government websites and it is stated that all their data is fact checked. I obtained this data by looking up datasets on student loan forgiveness and have credited educationdata.org for making it accessible to find this information.

### Expected Implications

Possible implications that could occur include policymakers having to create additional bills or finding ways in order to make higher education accessible financially. However, it can be implied that there will be conflicts between policymakers, students and government officials regarding the economy but there must be change made based on the data given and the research questions posed. As a result, policymakers will have to look back on the historical data of student debt and find out what makes it so difficult to repay. With this, they would be able to find the causes of the inability to pay student loans and aid or fix those causes so that it will not continue for generations. Technologists can use these answers as well in aiding how predictions of student loan debt can now be predicted for the future, which can either change or stay the same.

### Limitations

Based on the amount of data we have, it will be difficult to obtain the *cause* of student loan debt without doing outside non-dataset research, and far easier to recognize the *effect*. We can analyze how student loans have grown and how they affect different people and their economic stability, but examining the exact systems that enact student loans and have enforced these problems are outside the scope of our dataset. At the same time, we also need to consider that our findings may be heavily generalized; we cannot assume that high student loan debt correlates with low income. Working with a small amount of datasets, especially since our datasets may not have the exact variables we prefer in our problem domain, means we need to be careful when concluding results related to our intended questions.

### Appendix A: Questions

Are the tables in the dataset section just meant to represent the number of rows and columns? We found the wording a little ambiguous and weren't sure if we were meant to put the entire dataset or just the rows/columns in.
